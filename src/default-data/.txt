I am making something that uses data in this format
{
    "prefects": {
        Prefect ID: ["$$Prefect$$", {
            "id": Prefect ID,
            "IUD": Any unique 8 character hexadecimal (ex: "6999BDB2"),
            "name": ["$$CharacterName$$", {"sur": Surname, "first": First Name, "middle": Middle Name, "abrev": Abbreviation of Name, "other": Any other name (this may be null)}],
            "post_name": what post the prefect occupies in the school,
            "cls": ["$$Class$$", {"id": Class ID, "name": Class Name}],
            "img_path": Profile image (placeholder: "src/profile-images/p_id1.png"),
            "duties": {Day of the week (ex: "Wednesday"): Duties for that day (ex: ["Morning duties", "Assembly parade", "Cadet training"]), }
        }],
    },
    "teachers": {
        Teacher ID: ["$$Teacher$$", {
            "id": Teacher ID,
            "IUD": Any unique 8 character hexadecimal (ex: "51232123A"),
            "name": ["$$CharacterName$$", {"sur": Surname, "first": First Name, "middle": Middle Name, "abrev": Abbreviation of Name, "other": Any other name (this may be null)}],
            "department": ["$$Department$$", {"id": Department ID, "name": Department Name}],
            "subjects": [["$$Subject$$", {"id": Subject ID, "name": Subject Name, "cls": Class dataclass, "periods": [[Day of the week (ex: "Wednesday"), Amount of periods in the day], ]}], ],
            "img_path": Profile image (placeholder: "src/profile-images/p_id1.png"),
        }],
    }
}

"$$Value$$" defines a dataclass of name "Value". If a mapping or list ends in a comma, it means that the mapping or list is a collection of like objects.
So far, do you understand what has been given.
